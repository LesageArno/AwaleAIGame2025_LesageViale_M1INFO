\begin{abstract}
Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words in a single paragraph. Abstracts should explain to the general reader the major contributions of the article. References in the abstract must be cited in full within the abstract itself and cited in the text.

% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.

\dropcap{T}his template is provided to help authors submitting working papers for the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Computational Social Science (iLCSS) at UMD. The template was developed based on the PNAS template. Examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below to help you get started with .

Your introduction goes here!Please start your introduction without including the word ``Introduction'' as a section heading (except for math articles in the Physical Sciences section); this heading is implied in the first paragraphs. 



\section*{Sections: Theory, Methods, Results, Discussion...}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. 

\section{Figures and Tables}

Figures and Tables should be labeled and referenced in the standard way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.


\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{net_red}
\caption{Placeholder image of a Network with a long example caption to show justification setting.}
\label{fig:net}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:net} shows an example of how to insert a column-wide figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment. Figures wider than one column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide. Use \verb|\begin{SCfigure*}...\end{SCfigure*}| for a wide figure with side captions.

\subsection*{Tables}
In addition to including your tables within this manuscript file, PNAS requires that each table be uploaded to the submission separately as a “Table” file.  Please ensure that each table .tex file contains a preamble, the \verb|\begin{document}| command, and the \verb|\end{document}| command. This is necessary so that the submission system can convert each file to PDF.

\subsection*{Equations}

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment mentioned above for figures. Using only \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| keeps the equation in a two collum format


\begin{figure}[bt!]
\begin{align*}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \numberthis \label{eqn:example} \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
\end{align*}
\end{figure}


\section*{References}

References should be cited in alphabethical order; this will be done automatically via bibtex, e.g. \cite{Calvo2015}, 
and \cite{Birnir2018}. All references should be included in the main manuscript file.
